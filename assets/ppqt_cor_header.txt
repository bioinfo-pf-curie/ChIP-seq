#              <a href='https://github.com/kundajelab/phantompeakqualtools' target='_blank'>phantompeakqualtools</a>. Strand cross-correlation is computed as the Pearson’s linear correlation between the minus strand and the plus strand, after shifting minus strand by k base pairs. In the end we will have a cross-correlation value for each shift value, and they can be plotted against each other to generate a cross-correlation plot as shown below. The cross-correlation plot typically produces two peaks: a peak of enrichment corresponding to the predominant fragment length (highest correlation value) and a peak corresponding to the read length (“phantom” peak)."
